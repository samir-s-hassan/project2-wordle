# Project 2 - Wordle pt.2

Submitted by: Samir Hassan

Wordle is an app that that allows users to enter words in an attempt to guess the goal word. A user is notified if their word contains the letter in the goal word or even the letter in the right place for the goal word. If a user guesses the goal word, they have won the game and are communicated this by the styling of their word submission. The user can also change the amount of guesses they have, number of letters the word has, and apply the alien setting. The app also lets users reset the board and edit the settings as needed.
